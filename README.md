# 🗒️ MyNotes

A **MyNotes** built in **C++** that allows users to efficiently manage subject-wise notes.  
This program lets users log in, add, view, save, and load notes — designed with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, **composition**, and **STL containers** for structured data management and persistence through file handling.

## 💡 Overview

The **User Notes Manager** is a console-based C++ application where each user can:
- Log in securely.
- Add new notes categorized by subjects.
- View all notes or specific subject-wise notes.
- Save and load notes from files for persistence.

This project demonstrates:
- **OOP Design Principles** (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Composition)
- **STL Usage** (`map`, `vector`, `string`)
- **File Handling** for persistent storage

## 🚀 Features

- 🔑 **Login System:** Simple username-password-based authentication.
- 🧾 **Add Note:** Add subject-wise notes easily.
- 📚 **View Notes:** View notes by subject or view all at once.
- 💾 **Save Notes:** Persist data to a file for later use.
- 📂 **Load Notes:** Load previously saved notes from a file.
- 🧠 **OOP Design:** Structured using classes and composition for modularity.
- ⚙️ **STL Integration:** Uses C++ STL containers (`map`, `vector`, etc.) for efficient data storage and retrieval.
